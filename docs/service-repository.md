### Why we dont need interface abstraction for service class

We don’t need interfaces and binding for every service class because most service classes have a single implementation, so extra abstraction adds unnecessary complexity and boilerplate.
Having a "single implementation" means a class (such as a service class) is the only version or concrete realization of that functionality in your application. You don't have multiple different classes implementing the same interface or contract that might be swapped or substituted.

-   The service class does its job and there is no alternative or second implementation.
-   Therefore, you don’t need an interface because you do not expect to replace or mock this class with different versions.
-   Laravel's automatic dependency injection can handle this single class directly without extra abstraction.
